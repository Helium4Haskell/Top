### Helium

Helium is a functional programming language (a subset of Haskell) and a
compiler designed especially for teaching. The main developers and
initiators are Arjan van IJzendoorn, Rijk Jan van Haaften, Bastiaan
Heeren and Daan Leijen. Currently, Jurriaan Hage, and Bastiaan Heeren
maintain the compiler and associated tools. For more information about
Helium contact [us](mailto:helium4haskell@gmail.com).

Helium and the runtime lvmrun are on
[Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/helium). This means that
you can install the latest version of Helium by running
    cabal install helium
    cabal install lvmrun

The former of the two is the compiler (which will probably install a few
more packages, like Top and lvmlib), the second is the run-time. You can
then test the installation by running the program *texthint* and
evaluating a few expressions. The system is known to install with GHC
7.6.3 and GHC 7.8.x.

Other kinds of downloads are not supported anymore, and we advise
against using them.

### Top

Top is a library for constraint solving that is used by Helium to achieve
its high-quality type error messages.

### Beyond the standard distributions

All software associated with Helium is available from a publicly
available git repository at <https://github.com/Helium4Haskell/>.

These source distributions are to be used at your own risk.
